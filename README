AV-Vote -- an anonymous electronic voting system

1. What is it?

avvote is a Python implementation of "Anonymous Voting by 2-Round Public
Discussion", by Feng Hao, Peter Ryan, and Piotr Zielinski.

(or see copy included in this git repository.)

The eventual goal is to make this into a usable voting system, with a
peer-to-peer backend, PGP integration, and possibly Ka-Ping Yee's Pvote
pre-rendered ballot system -- http://pvote.org/

2. What assumptions are made?

 - You must have a working /dev/urandom.  All modern Linux (2.6.9 and
   later) and BSD systems should be fine.

3. How do you use it?
